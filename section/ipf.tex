\section{Formalization}

Individual Path Finding~\cite{luis2020plan,delling2009engineering} (IPF) represents the computation of multiple paths for each agent without considering collision in a given MAPF problem. The idea is then to use the paths for plan merging. We formalize IPF as a triple \((V,E,A)\) which is defined as MAPF is. The output is \(\tau\) being a non-empty set of set of paths. For each agent \(a \in A\), we have \(\tau[a]\) = \(\{\pi_0,\dots,\pi_n\}\). For lighter notation, we write \(\gamma_a = \tau[a]\), and also \(\gamma\) to refer to a set of path in general. Finally, a path \(\pi\) is defined as MAPF background~\ref{sec:background_mapf}. Paths composing \(\gamma\) can be of different length. The following figure illustrate a \(\tau = \{\gamma_r, \gamma_b, \gamma_g\}\) where its component being of different length; a red agents having \(|\gamma_r|=3\), a blue agent having \(|\gamma_b|=1\) and a green agent having \(|\gamma_g|=1\).

\end{figure}


Paths can have different inner properties, length, number of bends, coverage of the graph or inter-connected properties such as number of plan conflict, diversity, distant and so on. The work achieved in the thesis has been made considering only length of paths, potential conflict, diversity and distance.

\textbf{Path length} is a very noticeable property denoted as \(|\pi|\). We can splits paths into two length category; shortest paths, and non-shortest path. (Using shortest paths only and using as makespan the longest shorter path among agents for plan merging process still guarantee optimal solution. On the other hand, using not only shortest path can break the optimality.)

\subsection{Diversity and Distance}

Diversity tends to evaluate the variety of used vertices for a given set of paths, in other words, evaluations are performed within the scope of an agent. We introduce diversity as a sum of unique vertices visited at each time step. The following function described in equation~\ref{math:diversity_formula} computes diversity for a given \(\gamma\).The formula is based on the Hamming distance~\cite{hanaka2022computing}. 

\begin{equ}[H]
    \begin{equation}\label{math:diversity_formula}
        distance(\gamma) = |\bigcup^{\pi \in \gamma}{(\cup^{v,t \in \pi}{(v,t)})}|
    \end{equation}
    \caption{Diversity equation}
\end{equ}

Other diversity computation can be used, such as the Jaccard coefficient~\cite{habochal21a}. The difference between Jaccard coefficient and Hamming distance is that the first one focuses on the number of nodes that two paths have in common, while the second one focuses on the number of differences between the two paths. For our purpose, Hamming distance is more appropriate, however, it require that set are of the same length. Since paths in \(\gamma\) can be of different length, an adapted equation was necessary. Note that the equation~\ref{math:diversity_formula} do not gives an index that can be compared to other \(\gamma\)'s diversity. Furthermore, this equation is easy to implement with Clingo.

On the other hand, we can compute as property of paths the distance. It refers to how distant paths composing a \(\gamma\) are. Taken pair wisely, the distance between two paths is the sum of the distance between the vertices at each time step. Note that the distance between two vertices be an arbitrary function such as euclidean distance, shortest path length between these two vertices and so on. We refer to this arbitrary function as \(dist(v,v')\). In our case, we consider \(dist(v,v')\) as the euclidean distance between \(v\) and \(v'\). The formalization of the distance for a given \(\gamma\) is defined in the following equation~\ref{math:distance_formula}. 

\begin{equ}[H]
    \begin{equation}\label{math:distance_formula}
        diversity(\gamma) = \mathlarger{\sum_{\pi,\pi' \in \gamma, \pi \neq \pi' }}{(\sum_{t=0}^{t \rightarrow min(|\pi|,|\pi'|)}{dist(\pi[t],\pi'[t])})}
    \end{equation}
    \caption{Diversity equation}
\end{equ}


To conclude, the figure~\ref{fig:diversity_vs_distance} shows two \(\gamma\) of size \(|\gamma|=2\). The first one shows an example of the most diverse \(\gamma\) possible for this problem (multiple solutions exist, and we consider paths in \(\gamma\) of same length). On the other side, we have an example of the most distant \(\gamma\) possible for this problem. Red squares illustrate the difference between diversity and distance.

\section{Computation}


In this subsection, we describe two different approaches to compute multiple paths. Even if IPF is a side topic for this thesis, a concern was to be able to find \(x\) paths for each agent in a reasonable time. The following computation approaches are made with Clingo (ASP), it it likely that computing paths with programming languages such as C, C++, rust and so on, would be a better choice in terms of speed, however, sticking with Clingo has been chosen for straightforwardness and consistency of technology over the thesis. In addition, this section may give a starting point for future work on computing multiple paths using ASP and Clingo

\subsection{Naive IPF Computation}\label{sec:naive_ipf_computation}

The first approach that we describe is a direct modification of the encoding presented in the introduction. The translation adds a new constant to the encoding called \textit{npaths} which denotes the number of paths to compute per agent. Then, we add to most of the predicate, a new argument being the identifier of the path; a unique path is now defined with an agent \(R\) and a path identifier \(I\). As mentioned above, there is no need to consider conflicts in the encoding. With these new directives, we could obtain an encoding that we could call \textbf{Naive IPF}~\ref{lst:naive_ipf} which computes multiple paths for each agent in one call.

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle, caption={Naive IPF computation}, label={lst:naive_ipf}, numbers=left, ,escapechar=|]
    agent(R,1..npaths) :- agent(R). |\label{line:agent_id_and_path_id}|
    
    at(R,I,P,0) :- start(R,P), agent(R,I).

    time(1..horizon).
    {move(R,I,U,V,T) : edge(U,V)} 1 :- agent(R,I), time(T). |\label{line:move4_to_move5}|

    at(R,I,V,T) :- move(R,I,_,V,T). |\label{line:at3_to_at4}|
    :- move(R,I,U,_,T), not at(R,I,U,T-1).

    at(R,I,V,T) :- 
        at(R,I,V,T-1), 
        not move(R,I,V,_,T),
        time(T).

    :- { at(R,I,V,T) }!=1 , agent(R,I), time(T). 

    :- goal(R,V), not at(R,I,V,horizon).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The encoding described in listing~\ref{lst:naive_ipf} has the exact same principles as the base MAPF encoding (see listing~\ref{lst:base_mapf_encoding}). Line~\ref{line:agent_id_and_path_id} introduces id \(I\) for paths. Note that in this case, all agents would have the same number of paths. Of course, it is not necessary. We could use other predicates to describe how many paths are required for each agent of an instance. Then the lines~\ref{line:move4_to_move5} and~\ref{line:at3_to_at4} shows predicates \textit{move/4} and \textit{at/3} getting changed to predicates \textit{move/5} and \textit{at/4} now including the ID of paths.


The main flaw that comes with the encoding described is slowness. Requesting multiple paths per agent raises the space-search considerably. Even if we remove conflict consideration in the encoding, the fact that the grounder needs to ground the same predicate \(move/5\) \(|A| * npaths\) time. In addition, more variables induce a slower solving. 
However, this encoding gives us the opportunity to add properties to paths. For example, to implement diversity\ref{math:diversity_formula}, we can use \textit{weak constraint}, for instance, having a set of diverse paths would require the addition of the following line:

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle]
    #maximize{1,R,V,T : at(R,I,V,T)}.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

More definitive additions such as constraining specific paths of specific agents to have a defined length, a defined number of bends and so on, could be used.
Another flaw that comes with this encoding is that the is no guarantee that all paths for the same agent are different. However our \textbf{Naive IPF} encoding would still compute the requested number of paths for this agent \(a\) even though paths are the same. This can be fixed using inner collision; but we would tend to revert to classical MAPF solving.

\subsection{Base IPF computation}\label{sec:base_ipf_computation}

By using multi-shot solving and assumption~\cite{karoscwa21a}, it  possible to ground both predicates \(at\) and \(move\) once for all agents. To do so, we have to tweak the naive IPF encoding described in section~\ref{sec:naive_ipf_computation} We obtain the following encoding in listing~\ref{lst:base_ipf}. This encoding can be interpreted as simple pathfinding that will be executed one agent at a time. Furthermore, \(start/2\) and \(goal/2\) predicates are not necessary; these are handled by assumptions.


\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle, caption={Base IPF computation}, label={lst:base_ipf}]
    time(1..horizon).

    {at(V,0) : vertex(V)} = 1.

    { move(U,V,T) : edge(U,V)} 1 :- time(T).

    at(V,T) :- move(_,V,T).
            :- move(U,_,T), not at(U,T-1).

    :- { at(V,T) } != 1, time(T).

    at(V,T) :- 
        at(V,T-1), 
        not move(V,_,T), 
        time(T).

    current_agent(R) :- at(V,0), start(R,V). |\label{line:identify_current_agent}|
    at(GV,T) :- |\label{line:stay_after_goal_reached}|
        at(GV,T-1), 
        time(T), 
        goal(R,GV), 
        current_agent(R). 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Lines~\ref{line:identify_current_agent} retrieve the current agent the solver is working on. By crossing the initial \(at/2\) position given by assumption to fact \(start/2\), we can retrieve the current agent. Line~\ref{line:stay_after_goal_reached} is then designed to guarantee that once the path of an agent reaches its goal, the agent remains at its goal location.


The flowchart described in figure~\ref{fig:flowchart_ipf_computation} illustrate process of base IPF computation. It first ground the instance with the encoding, then solve with the start and goal positions of an agent as assumptions. Finally, identify \textit{at/2} with agent ID and model number. We use the model number to identify different paths of the same agent; the model enumeration represents different possible assignations for the problem, which means multiple different paths. In summary, requesting to the ASP solver \(n\) models means requesting \(n\) paths for an agent.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Flowchart of IPF computation using multi-shot solving and assumption}\label{fig:flowchart_ipf_computation}
    \includegraphics[width=\widthimg]{img/flowchart_ipf_computation.drawio.png}
\end{figure}


We define \(1 \leq p \leq k\), if solving an instance with \(k\) requested models, the number of possible models \(p\) can be lower. 
We use a Python wrapping to control and manage assumptions. A pseudocode of the wrapper is denoted in listing~\ref{lst:pseudo_code_ipf_wrapper}

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle, caption={Pseudo code of base IPF encoding wrapper}, label={lst:pseudo_code_ipf_wrapper}, numbers=left, ,escapechar=|]
    result |\(\leftarrow\)| list()
    ground(instance + base IPF encoding)

    for each agent in instance |\{|
        assume(initial and goal position)
        solve()

        for each model |\{|
            translate `at/2'|\(\rightarrow\)|`at/4'
            add translation to result
        |\}|
    |\}|  
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

A nice property that comes with this approach is that since we use model enumeration to create different paths, if Clingo enumerates fewer models than requested, we can assume that there are no other paths possible of this length. It can be used to enumerate more paths, considering higher path length.

Base IPF computing reduces computation time significantly; given the way Clingo works, decomposing the problem into one agent at a time and reusing grounding works way better than trying to solve multiple problems at once, which naive IPF computation is doing. It does, however, compute random paths. In order to compute the shortest paths, we can use the optional predicates described in list~\ref{list:instance_format_explanation_part2}. Assumptions allow us to force \(goal/2\) predicate to be reached a specific time step,  We can then change the goal position assumption and force it to be reached at a certain time step instead of at the horizon point. We can use the same principle to compute paths of different lengths for one agent; this require an additional solving and translation process.

Furthermore, in this process, we can compute additional paths with a modified time step associated with the goal. This addition enables agents to reach their destination xx time steps later than the originally defined duration. This strategy proves valuable when a limited number of paths are computed, as it provides the IPF solver with extra possibilities to generate additional paths.

Given the way base IPF computation works, it seems difficult to assign different properties to the paths as the naive IPF approach does. To do so, we can request a large number of paths and create a subset out of them that satisfy chosen properties. 






\subsection{Filters}

Compared to naive IPF computation, we can not manage easily path properties. We can however create subset of previously computed \(\gamma\) by filtering paths given some criteria. A filter \(f\) is defined as such; \( f(\gamma) \subseteq \gamma \). We introduce two criteria function. The first being a function selecting \(k\) most diverse paths following~\ref{math:diversity_formula} and the second one a function selecting \(k\) most distant paths following~\ref{math:distance_formula}.

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle, caption={Encoding of diverse filter}, label={lst:diversity_filter}, numbers=left, ,escapechar=|]
    #const npath = 5.

    {dpath(R,I): at(R,I,_,_)} npath :-  agent(R). |\label{line:div_select_path_p1}|
    #maximize {1@2,R,I : dpath(R,I)}. |\label{line:div_select_path_p2}|
    
    dpath(R,I,V,T) :- dpath(R,I), at(R,I,V,T). |\label{line:div_retrieving_pos}|
        
    #maximize {1@1R,V,T : dpath(_,_,V,T)}. |\label{line:maximizing_diversity}|
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Diversity encoding (listing~\ref{lst:diversity_filter}) starts by picking for each agent, at most \textit{npath} paths among all path available denoted in line~\ref{line:div_select_path_p1}. On the next line~\ref{line:div_select_path_p2}, we use an optimization statement to have as most path possible; as written previously, it is not forced to have \(\gamma\) composing \(\tau\) of same size. Using this optimization statement  avoid unsat when no enough paths are available for an agent. Line~\ref{line:div_retrieving_pos} is retrieving position and time step of selected paths. From these selected path, we can, as described in equation~\ref{math:diversity_formula}, count the tuple \((V,T)\) and maximize them with another optimization statement denoted line~\ref{line:maximizing_diversity}.

\begin{minipage}[H]{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle, caption={Encoding of distance filter}, label={lst:distance_filter}, numbers=left, ,escapechar=|]
    #const npath = 5.

    {dpath(R,I): at(R,I,_,_)} npath :-  agent(R). |\label{line:dist_select_path_p1}|
    #maximize {1@1,R,I : dpath(R,I)}. |\label{line:dist_select_path_p2}|
    
    dpath(R,I,V,T) :- dpath(R,I), at(R,I,V,T).|\label{line:dist_retrieving_pos}|
         
    dist(R,I1,I2,T, (X1-X2)*(X1-X2) + (Y1-Y2)*(Y1-Y2)) :- |\label{line:dist_computing_distance}|
        dpath(R,I1,(X1,Y1),T),  
        dpath(R,I2,(X2,Y2),T), I1!=I2. 

    dsum(R,DS) :- |\label{line:dist_intermediate}|
        DS=#sum{D:dist(R,I1,I2,_,D), dpath(R,I1), dpath(R,I2)}, 
        agent(R).

    #maximize {1@2,D : dsum(R,D)}.|\label{line:maximize_distance}|
\end{lstlisting}

\end{minipage}

Note that line~\ref{line:dist_intermediate} and line~\ref{line:maximize_distance}


Distance encoding (listing~\ref{lst:distance_filter}) starts as diversity encoding does, by picking for each agent, at most \textit{npath} paths among all path available, maximizing the number of selected path and then retrieving their position and time step (from line~\ref{line:dist_select_path_p1} to~\ref{line:dist_retrieving_pos}). Line~\ref{line:dist_computing_distance} introduces a new predicate \(dist/4\) which denotes the root-square-less euclidean distance (in our case, computing the exact distant is not necessary) of two different paths of the same agent. We then have an intermediate rule line \ref{line:dist_intermediate} which sums the distance of paths for each agents, which is then used in the weak constraint statement line~\ref{line:maximize_distance} to maximize the distance issued by \(D\).

As shown in the figure~\ref{fig:overview_ipf} illustrating the overview of IPF, using filters is not necessary. Filters mimic that IPF could be computed considering properties for paths.
